**Why must we choose you?**

Since childhood I have always been a tech enthusiast, I am very keen on grabbing more and more facts about anything tech related. I have a little expierience on coding too. I think joining amFOSS will help me learn more and more about programming and other tech related geeky stuffs. I am more of a lazy ass when it comes to home chores and college assignments but when it comes to anything techie, I am always there.

**What is your plan for the next 6 months?**

Well I have scheduled a time table as of now. I am thinking of going on a bing marathon of a course that seems quite mesmerizing to me. Its Python for data science and ML. I have found a great source for this subject, maybe I will be learning from there for the nect 6 months.

**How would you contribute back to the club?**

I would love to contribute to amFOSS by spreding my knowledge to others, by spreading more and more knowledge, I want is that too eradicate this fear of programming from everybody's mind and thus bringing young and determined  coders in our club.

**Do you have any feedback for the selection process?**

The selection process is quite good. The tasks were challenging yet fun doing it. It helped me learn various things that i wasn't aware of, and the time given for doing the tasks was quite sufficient I guess. So yeah i loved it!
