step-1 North
First, you need to create a directory and name it Coordinates-Location and go into that directory. The termial command would be mkdir Coordinates-Location.
Now create a Directory called North and go into it, and implement the following step by step. The terminal command would be (i)cd ~/Coordinates-Location/ and press enter and after this type (ii) mkdir North. North file created!
Now we will have to solve the problems and answer it as asigned us to do.
Make a text file on Linux: cat > NDegree.txt. Add data and press CTRL+D to save the NDegree.txt when using cat on Linux.
Same here too as above cat > NMinutes.txt. Add data and press CTRL+D to save the NMinutes.txt when using cat on Linux.
Here too the same cat > NSeconds.txt. Add data and press CTRL+D to save the NSeconds.txt when using cat on Linux.
After completition of all the tasks, Make a file NorthCoordinate.txt formed from the combination of the files you had created in the above steps-(i),(ii),(iii). The terminal command used here was cat NDegree.txt NMinutes.txt NSeconds.txt > NorthCoordinate.txt
Copy the NorthCoordinate.txt to the Coordinate-Location directory and rename it as North.txt and delete the file created in step-(iv).

Step-4 East
Create a Directory called East go into it, and again implement the following step by step.  TThe terminal command would be (i)cd ~/Coordinates-Location/ and press enter and after this type (ii) mkdir East. East file created!
Now we will have to solve the problems and answer it as asigned us to do.
Make a text file on Linux: cat > EDegree.txt. Add data and press CTRL+D to save the EDegree.txt when using cat on Linux.
Same here too as above cat > EMinutes.txt. Add data and press CTRL+D to save the EMinutes.txt when using cat on Linux.
Here too the same cat > ESeconds.txt. Add data and press CTRL+D to save the ESeconds.txt when using cat on Linux.
After completition of all the tasks, Make a file EastCoordinate.txt formed from the combination of the files you had created in the above steps-(i),(ii),(iii). The terminal command used here was cat NDegree.txt EMinutes.txt ESeconds.txt > EastCoordinate.txt
Copy the EastCoordinate.txt to the Coordinate-Location directory and rename it as East.txt and delete the file created in step-(iv).
