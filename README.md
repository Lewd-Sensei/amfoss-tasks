**About my tasks**

The tasks were pretty neat and very creative and it has made me develop various skills. I had some issues with the tasks and it was pretty hard  but I didn't gave hope. At the same time I have learnt various tech related stuffs in here and i hope it will come in handy someday!!

**About Me**

Hello Seniors!

This is Thanush Nair and I currently reside in Gandhidham, Gujarat. I did my grade 12th in Mount Litera Zee School, Gandhidham. My school life was pretty average. I started coding from 6th grade and the first language I coded was C Bsaic, it was pretty exciting at that time. So yeah from there my love for coding started❤️. Still now I am a complete sucker when it comes to coding😐. I have also attended many tech fests that happens nearby and yeah it was pretty exciting. For me amFOSS is a club where i can contribute and learn skills, the skils which will come handy in the future
